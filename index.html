    <h1>Exercise 1.0  - LINKING JS</h1>

    <p>*Create an HTML file and a JS file and link them to each other. Let’s open our file in Google  Chrome and open the Developer Tool and go to the Console tab. This is where we will see our JS in action!</p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.1 </h2>
    <p>Within the JS file, create a new variable called myName and assign it with the value of your name. Use your new knowledge of var, let and const. </p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.2 </h2>
    <p>Create a new variable and store your age.</p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.3 </h2>
    <p>Create a new variable called “future job” and assign it “ web developer”.</p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.4 </h2>
    <p>Connect these bits of information together with either concatenation or interpolation, so that it creates the phrase “My name is (name), I am (age) years old and I will soon become a  web developer.” and log it in the console! Save and refresh the page in Chrome to see our new code working in the console! </p>
